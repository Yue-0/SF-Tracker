# ONNX File

__English__ | [简体中文](README_cn.md)

We use YOLOv6 for person detection. You can download the ONNX file of YOLOv6 from [here](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6/tree/main/deploy/ONNX#download), then rename it to `YOLOv6.onnx` and place it in this folder.

We use our previous work HiT for tracking arbitrary targets. You can refer to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06904) to build the ONNX file, then rename it to `HiT.onnx` and place it in this folder.
